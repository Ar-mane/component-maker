# Component Maker

Component Maker is a versatile VS Code extension designed to simplify the process of generating new component files using custom templates. This tool is framework and language-agnostic, allowing you to use it with any technology of your choice. While this documentation demonstrates its usage with React and TypeScript, feel free to adapt it to suit your preferred stack.

## Features

- **Easy Component Generation**: Simply right-click in the file editor or on a file in the explorer, and choose `üìêMake Component` to generate a component as needed.

- **Customizable Templates**: Create and customize your own template folder to match your project's requirements. The extension clones your model, similar to how plop does, allowing for flexibility in your file structure.

## Getting Started

1. **Generated Templates**:
   - The extension generates the following templates on startup, which you can customize or extend as needed:

2. **Customize or Add Templates**:
   - You can modify the existing templates or add new ones according to your project's structure. The generated templates serve as a starting point for your customization.

#### React Component Example

Below is an example of a React component generated by the extension. You can find this example in the `component` template:

     ```ts
     import { Container } from "./_ComponentName_.style";

     import type { FC } from "react";

     interface I_ComponentName_Props {}

     const _ComponentName_: FC<I_ComponentName_Props> = ({}) => {
       return <Container></Container>;
     };

     export default _ComponentName_;
     ```

3. **Configure Your `.cmrc.json` File**:

   - The extension generates a `.cmrc.json` file on startup. Adjust the configuration based on your needs to match the templates directory:

     ```json
     {
       "dir": ".cm_templates",
       "templates": [
         {
           "label": "React Component",
           "detail": "Default template for components",
           "templateDir": "component",
           "variable": "_ComponentName_",
           "destinationDir": "src/components",
           "files": [
             {
               "sourceFile": ".templates/component/__componentName__.style.ts",
               "destinationDir": "src/components/__componentName__"
             },
             // Add more files as needed
           ],
           "effects": [
             {
               "file": "src/service/dependency-injection.ext",
               "action": "edit",
               "concat": "end",
               "content": "// serviceRegister.singleton(new _ComponentName_Service())"
             }
             // Add more effects as needed
           ]
         }
         // Add more templates as needed
       ]
     }
     ```

   - Adjust the `dir`, `templates`, and their respective properties according to your project structure.
