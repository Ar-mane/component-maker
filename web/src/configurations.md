# Configurations

Component Maker provides flexibility in configuring templates and directory structures to match your project's needs. Here's a breakdown of the available configurations:

- **Template Directory (`dir`)**: Specify the folder where templates are stored. The default is `.cm_templates`.
- **Templates (`templates`)**: Define a list of templates to be used for component generation operations. Each template can have various properties, such as label, detail, template directory, variable interpolation, destination directory, files affected, and effects.
- **Special Files (`SpecialFile`)**: Configure special files, including the source file and destination directory.
- **Effects (`Effect`)**: Define file effects, such as post-updating a file.

Adjust these configurations in the `.cmrc.json` file according to your project structure and requirements to optimize your component creation process with Component Maker.
